Write me a function to generate/print/store the first "n" prime numbers and then explain how it works and how efficient it is.

It works well because:
  It's an algorithmic question so it requires the interviewee
  to be able to think and then explain their thinking - so you
  can see how their brain works.

It's language independent.
  Hardly anyone gets it completely right (edge cases)
