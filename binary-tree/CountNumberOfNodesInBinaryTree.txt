Count the number of nodes in a binary tree, given this interface:

  public interface IBinaryTree<T>
  {
      IBinaryTree<T> Left();

      IBinaryTree<T> Right();

      T Data();
  }


And this assistant class:

  class BinaryTreeNodeCounter
  {
      static int CountNodes( IBinaryTree tree )
      {
          // TODO: What goes here?
      }
  }


It demonstrates knowledge of:

  how a tree (binary tree in particular) works
  the recursive definition of a binary tree
  recursive methods and how base cases stop recursion
  what counting a single node means
