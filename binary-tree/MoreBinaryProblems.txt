1) Write a function to reverse a singly linked list.

2) Given a binary tree, find the depth of the binary tree.
(This question tests their ability to write recursive code. Lets me check if they have their base case intact.)

3) Write a procedure for binary searching an array of integers.
(Like Jon Bentley says (in Programming Pearls), many people tend to make mistakes writing binary search.
 One can then follow up with finding bugs, writing test cases, running through the code, etc..)
